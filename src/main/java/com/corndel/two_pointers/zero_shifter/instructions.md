# ZeroShifter

## The Problem

You're given an array of numbers. Your task is to complete the two methods on the `ZeroShifter` class they should move
all the `0`s to the **end of the array**,
while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Return a new array with the result.

## Brute Force Solution: `ZeroShifter.shiftZerosNestedLoop`

Iterate through the array:

- If you find a zero, remove it with `splice()` and `push(0)` to the end
- Keep track of how many zeros you've moved

- Time complexity: O(nÂ²) due to repeated splicing and shifting
- Space complexity: O(n) due to copying

## Two-Pointer Solution: `ZeroShifter.shiftZerosTwoPointers

1. Create a copy of the array.
2. Use a `write` pointer starting at 0.
3. Loop through the array:
    - If the current element is **non-zero**, write it to the `write` position
      and increment `write`.
4. After the loop, fill the remaining elements of the array with `0`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Avoids costly `splice()` operations and keeps non-zero order
